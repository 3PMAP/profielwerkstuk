# profielwerkstuk
This repo contains the markdown source files for our paper. It's written in markdown, though heavenly injected with LaTeX. 
This is because we use [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) for converting: markdown -> LaTeX -> pdf.

This repo:
- 00_*.md kind of files are the source files.
- in `bib/` are is the bibtex file. Also a csl file for apa style.
- `img/` contains all images.
- create is a 'bash script' (well...) which just runs pandoc with all given commands. Nothing special.
- prothesehand.pdf is the output file. The result. El resultado. Exitus.
